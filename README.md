# ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Rethinking Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan* by Richard McElreath (2nd ed.). Each chapter's exercises are saved as separate R script files in the `chapters` folder.

## Repository Structure

- `chapters/` - Contains an R script for each chapter's exercises.
- `README.md` - This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Textbook Citation
McElreath, R. (2020). *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan* (2nd ed.). Chapman and Hall/CRC.

## Practice Problem Solutions
For additional reference, see the official practice problem solutions: [PDF](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/rethinking/rethinking_solutions_2.pdf)

## Usage
To explore the exercises, clone this repository and navigate to the `chapters` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gracehandley/statistical_rethinking.git
cd statistical_rethinking/chapters
```

Open any `.R` file in RStudio or run it in an R environment to see the solutions in action.

This repository is a work in progress, and I will update it as I complete more exercises.
